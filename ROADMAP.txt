#### README updates
[] advanced YAML-fu with variables
[] miscInfo


## configTriage
[] loggingInfo
[] trajectoryAtoms -- do we allow for multiple trajectories per simulation (or too complex??)
[] miscInfo


## drFirstAid
[] alternate between EM and MD to fix problem
[] if no checkpoint exists at all, run an EM from previous?

## Extra features
[x] pH for protonation
[] more metaDynamics parameters
[x] maxRetries for firstAid as a config parameter
[x] different box geometies
[x] heavy protons and fast intergrators [NEED TO BENCHMARK WHETHER THIS MAKES IT FASTER]

## drLogger
[x] do clean code

## drCheckup
[] if this fails, continue with everything
[] redo PDF image sizes and locations

## drMethodScribe
[x] general simulation infos

## drConfigWriter
[x] hardwareInfo: null appearing in automatically generated config files

## drPdbTriage
[x] HIS, HIP ect being identified as a UAA 

## drRestraints
[??] improper restraints

## drCheckup
[x] look at convergance again -- be a bit more lenient!

## drPrep
[x] protein protonation running even when protons in starting structure??
[x] handle exceptions for all prep steps

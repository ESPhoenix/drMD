[] need more stuff when simulations are running



## Extra features
[] more metaDynamics parameters

[x] if this fails, continue with everything
[] redo PDF image sizes and locations
[] Display relative energies for Potential, Kinetic and Total
[] better convergance checker

## drMethodsWriter
[] metaDynamics 


## drMeta
[] frequency config -> drMeta
[] free energy output at the end
[] More options for forces
    [] minValue
    [] maxValue
    [] biasWidth


## hotfixes
[] throw error when ligands are in the same chain as protein
[] drMethodsWriter try except

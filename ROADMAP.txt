#### README updates
[x]  redo installation instructions
[]  work out what needs changing


### config changes
[x]  generalInfo -> hardwareInfo???
[]  sim -> simInfo??  [doesnt actually have a name]

## configTriage
[] loggingInfo
[] trajectoryAtoms


## init lists as tuples in own script??


## drFirstAid
[] alternate between EM and MD to fix problem
[] if no checkpoint exists at all, run an EM from previous?


## Extra features
[] pH for protonation
[] more metaDynamics parameters
[] maxRetries for firstAid as a config parameter
[] different box geometies
[] heavy protons and fast intergrators

## drLogger
[] do clean code

## drCheckup
[?] close all figs
[] re-do convergance check, needs a pre-set per-measurement tol
    - did the last 1 ns (or last 10% of simulation if simulation is less than 1 ns)
    - differ more than {tol} for a significant amount of time?

[] for rmsd checkup, ensure that big files dont overload memory
[] if this fails, continue with everything


## drSim
[x] options for what we put in reporters
